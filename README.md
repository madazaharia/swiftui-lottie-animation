How to add animated assets using Lottie in SwiftUI

Named after Lotte Reiniger and developed by Airbnb, Lottie is a mobile library for iOS, macOS, Android and React Native that renders After Effect animations in a native app. 
Animations are exported in the JSON format and are then rendered in real time.
It is open source and can be found on GitHub.

Happy animations!
